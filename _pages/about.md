    <h4>Hi, there ðŸ‘‹</h4>
    <ul>
    Currently I'm diligently pursuing my second-year MFA in Visual Communication Design with a focus on UI/UX interaction Design and a minor on illustration at Rochester Institute of Technology. In the past, I studied Environmental Design. BA at Nanjing Forestry University, and dabbled in graphic.
    <br>
    <br>
I found myself fascinated by making the interaction flow more friendly and creating various illustrations to served for the digital products. That was the moment I realized that I'm going to be a Product Illustrator / Designer in this world.
