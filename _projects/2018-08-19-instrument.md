### Problem

**Instrument** hires the best people with strong skill sets, but they are not leveraging the efficiently enough to help others growth and accomplish their expansion plans.


### Solution

Create a resources platform for employees to form groups and identify internal and extranet events to assist in leveraging your skills to each other.

### Objective

<br>
<div class="row fit">
<div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-12">

    From the list of different user groups needs, my primary focus was on providing a tool for employees<b> to learn additional skills from peers and empower each other.</b>

<br>  
<br>   
    <b>Stakeholder needs and requirements üëâüèª</b>
    
  </div>
  
  <div class="col-lg-9 col-sm-12">

 </div>

<div class="row fit">
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/shape1.png">
    
<h5 style="margin-left:0"> Exploration </h5>

<br>
    Create a way for employees to join different types of groups  to help them get more knowledge and encourage them to share with useful resources
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/shape2.png">
    
<h5 style="margin-left:0"> Involvement</h5>
   <br> 
    Help employees time-management about join events. Allow employees to see if there is any novelty at their company easier.
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/shape3.png">

<h5 style="margin-left:0"> Management </h5>
    <br>
    The Instrument events are published by different types of interest groups so that employees could find the events' history as soon as possible.
    
  </div>

### Research & Competitors study

<div class="row fit">
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/competitors/competitor1.png">
    
<h5 style="margin-left:0"> Meetup </h5>

<br>
    <b>Meetup</b> brings people together in thousandas of cities to do more of what they want to do in life. It brings people together to do, explore, teach and learn.
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/competitors/competitor2.png">
    
<h5 style="margin-left:0"> Workplace</h5>
   <br> 
    To help people in businesses connect and discover new ways of working. Groups are shared spaces for people to work together in teams, discuss common interests and share ideas. And groups are for working with anyone, even people at other companies. Conversation moves quickly, a message on Work Chat, often gets you the answer you need or keeps the whole team in the loop.
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
    <img src="/images/instrument/competitors/competitor3.png">

<h5 style="margin-left:0"> Messenger </h5>
    <br>
    The Messenger web app interface shows the importance of providing a platform for employees to communicate and discuss what interested them based on their joined interest groups. So, I create "group chat" as a similar use case for employees better-communication.
  
    
  </div>

### Icon

![](/images/instrument/icon.png)


I was trying to create a set of the icon based on Instrument design trend, the <b>clean</b>, <b>linear</b> and <b>easy to read</b> icons. It designed to help users to read quickly with the tiny things so that they can figure out what for next step easier.
