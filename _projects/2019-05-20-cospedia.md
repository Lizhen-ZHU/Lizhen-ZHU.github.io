### Introduction


Interactive - Educational - Clothing Display Website.

<img src="/images/cos/34.gif">

**COSPEDIA** is a compound word which combines costume and Wikipedia. It helps fashion design students/lovers to have a comprehensive understanding of the history of clothing by displaying the historical development and characteristics of Chinese and western clothing from ancient to modern times. 


<br>

### Define Problem:

The learning materials today for fashion designer are high cost, plane graphic, and lack of interaction.There is a need for more engagement and enjoyment. 

<br>


### Potential User
- The student majoring in history, culture, fashion
- Fashion design enthusiast.
- The fashion designer.
...

<br>

### Goal

As a result, it would be valuable if we give them **game-like experience** for inspiration, supporting them in **creating, designing and showing their own ideas**, reflect on what they have learned and create their own project. Empowering users to be creative and expressive develop their thinking based on their knowledge.

<br>

### Design Rationale:

<br>

<div class="row fit">
  <div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12">

</div>
</div>


The website shows the 3000 year of evolution in costume, from Zhou dynasty/ Ancient Egypt to modern times.

The page is designed into 2 halves, in the right hand side is **China fashion**, in the left hand side is **Western costume**. It would give you a clear comparison between different kinds of costumes in the same history period, which is a new way of presenting information.

Also, there are hot spot to show the detail, and the background will also change with your mouse. Inside **Qing Dynasty and Baroque period**, there are detailed description and intercatiin for discovery learning, for example, scroll reveal effect to show the pattern; ebook to display evolution; drag reveal to show comparison.

In the last part, based on Constructivism learning theory, there is a **design game** for user to refect on what they learned and build their own project. I use jQuery to realize the drag/resize, and firebase to save and upload. Thus, building a supportive community to inspire users.

### Detail page:
