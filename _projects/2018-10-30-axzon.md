### Project Brief:

As a combination of **social-networking** and **learning management system**, Axon provides its users a virtual learning environment and platform that featured by professional networks, online courses, and performance management. This social learning network enables users to connect with and learn from anyone, anywhere, and anytime to develop knowledge and skills.

<br><br>
 There are 4 unique features that distinguish our app from others:
<br><br>
1. **Power of social network** inspires and motivates users to keep learning. Our main page looks like a social media site. By following institutions, teachers, and friends, the user can receive the timely information of the new course, peer’s progress, etc. There also have a ‘story’ section that enables users to take advantage of the fragmented time to learn something.

2. **Gamification** engenders entertaining learning experience. In the profile page, there are visualized progress bar of their own and their friends’ progress. By comparing those data, the user will get more motivated.

3. Learning activities are specially designed for **mobile** devices. Compare with other course support application like ‘canvas’, our app gives more options designed for mobile. Such as you can listen to the article rather than read it; reply to others through voice and video; etc. 

4. AI/Machine learning **personalizes** the learning experience. In the explore page, the recommended courses are based on users’ learning progress and the big data from other users, which provide the exact course that you may need in the certain learning process.

<br><br>

In terms of the context of use: Corporates can create and deliver training for employees; educational institutions could provide m-learning experience for their students; individual learners can learn anywhere, anytime, especially in informal learning settings (home, subway, etc.)
