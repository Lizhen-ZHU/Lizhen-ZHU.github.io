## The Ideas

This is my first experience living with three roommates, and each of us comes from different country. In this <b>culturally-diverse</b> living situation, everyone is <b>unfamiliar</b> with others' daily routines and habits.
Sometimes others make noises annoying me simply because I'm being too quiet at home and **they didn't know**. But in fact, I was just laying on my bed and don't want to get up. 

Besides, we sometimes curious about is there anyone at home so they can **give us a hand** to pick our packages or **give or take a free-ride** to the market together.

## Why Dormie?

Every roommate has their own schedule where they might disturb each other's daily routine. 

_"I might make some noise at room, but I am worried about they are at home that time"_

_"I want to take shuttle home with her together, but I have to wait for her reply."_

_"I don't have a car, but I need someone picking me up to market if they are in convenience."_

_"It's embarrassing to knock the doors to ask somebody if they are at home."_

_..._

I was trying to help the roommates can get help with each other based on knowing the presence of one another by this function.
Connecting with roommates can save time, provide life convenient and enhance roommates' relationships.

## Cute UI!

I was trying to use bold but clean color system to build this interface more clearly for users. As this product is designed for students. To show the teenagers personality I create the illustrations of **houses selected** , **emojis status** or **avatar** to create the energetic and young stylish into the design

### Creating Status

To help roommates know about each others'<b> different schedule </b>well, and to <b>decrease unnecessarily troublesome</b>. There is a function allowed user create their<b> real-time emoji </b>showing their status. Such as "I'm sleeping, I'm working, and I'm boring... "

## My Dormie Tour 

Hey! I'm Xuechun. This is my first time using the Dormie app. Let's have a tour on the Dormie app together! 
#### <span style="color:#D8D8D8"> 1. JOINING THE CIRCLE </span>

</center>

 _How smooth and pretty the on boarding expriences (NUX design) are!_ After a quick signing up, I join the **Dorm Circle** that Namhee have created by entering the associated **Circle Invite-Code**.


<br>
#### <span style="color:#D8D8D8"> 2. SHARING  LOCATIONS <span>

  <video width="70%" autoplay loop muted playsinline >
    <source src="/images/dormie/dormie-flow2.min.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</center>

##### Left-hand Side: Location Customization

Now, I see three **Locations** having been set by the circle. 

I can change the ordering of my preferences and set 
the HOME as the first one in my homepage. And more importantly, I can adjust my own **Location Scope** of HOME that could be shared with my other roommates. I kinda want to be more honest to my roommates so afterall I choose the most accurate scope.

*Well, what if sometimes I suddenly don’t want to share my location?* It’s actually pretty easy to turn it off temporarily or permanently whenever I want, and they won't know ;)

<br>

##### Right-hand Side: Styling!

To make this experienve beautiful, each place need to select a <b>home illustration</b> as a sign

<br>
#### <span style="color:#D8D8D8"> 3. CHECK LOCATION<span>

  </video>
</center>

At present, it's convenient to know the Juile and Namhee is at HOME, Andrea and I is at SCHOOL, and no one is at WEGMANS

<br>
#### <span style="color:#D8D8D8"> 4. CREATE STATUS <span>

  </video>
</center>

Today, I baked some biscuits,  so I would like to share with them together! And I got Namhee is sleeping right now. This function helps roommates to know more about each other's schedule easily. 

<br>
#### <span style="color:#D8D8D8">5. INTELLIGENT CHAT <span>

  </video>
</center>

It intelligently provides the common sentences for roommates! I don't need to type for a long while anymore! And I also could back-up other sentences for next time.

## My Breakaway

Since this project concept was addressing one or multiple aspects of college life, how to make the dormitory, this small community, to get along with each other better is what I was trying to solve.
During the design iterations and getting feedback from classmates, I found out that there is a lot to consider when designing for the location-sharing platform for roommates. Everyone cares about our privacy, and we don't want to be tracked by others. 

After I finished this work, I found an issue about users won't like to know about other's status by opening this app every time. So, maybe auto-sending notification to show who is at home right now, or someone creates a status blah blah... is another solution for convenience.
