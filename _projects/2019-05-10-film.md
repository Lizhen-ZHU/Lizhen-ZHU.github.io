## Project Overview

<br><br>

“Filmmaking is about turning the intangible into the tangible” (Theodosakis, 2009), so **how to fill the gap between intangible film terminology and the tangible real-world filmmaking practice?** This website provides an accessible and effective way to bridge the gap and supports users to explore, get inspired and build their own projects. 
<br><br><br><br>

## Design Process

<br>

Action is a website designed to facilitate film learning and filmmaking. I conducted the user-centered research and design process, from interviewing  stakeholders to creating interactive prototypes, and validating design decisions by testing with target users. 
 
• **User Research**: conducted observation, stakeholder report, and competitive
analysis to articulate the need.

• **Product Iteration**: Designed effective personas, user journeys, storyboards, wireframes and interactive prototypes through initial research of user needs, business goals, usability testing and iterative design to design intuitive and engaging products.

• **Product Assessment**: Performed heuristic evaluation and user test to improve usability as well as the product features.

<br>

From our **observation** in communication classes at Wake Forest University and Teachers College of Columbia University, which are two representing elite institutions, we noticed that learning process in filmmaking would not be efficient if it is led by instructor alone. 

During the filmmaking process, there is also a need for a more **effective and visualized tool** to support their learning and projects. The existing way of learning film terminology is so rigid and boring. 

If you type in ‘film terminology’ in Google search and look up the first 10 websites, all of the glossaries are divided into alphabetical order in a list form, 9 of them are merely explained by plain text, and 4 out of 10 are even unclickable. As Metz argued, the film is based on visual explanation and “individual cinematic texts construct their own meaning systems” (Metz, 1974). This emphasizes the importance that students should learn film by dynamic image, pictures, colors, dialogue that is exclusive to film. 
<br><br>

#### Stakeholder Report

Based on the interview with the **stakeholder**, Masen, who is a student majoring in film studies and has taken several film course at both introductory and intermediate level,  he mentions his need for **creating a platform** that is able to search based on tags to each word so people can search and see **what technique** they want to use, and he also suggests to have a function that can support his **real-world project**. 


The personas represent users’ goals and pain points that helped me to prioritize different user needs to guide the converging phase of my design process.

<br>


Through the observation and stakeholder report, we found that, for students who major in film studies and communication, there is often an existing gap between professors’ scheduled course content to explain film terminology and students’ perceived knowledge about film terminology and their applications of the film techniques while shooting a movie or film project. Thus, we designed a comprehensive platform that supports **filmmaking and learning** process.

Our goal is to help the students and film professionals in achieving a satisfying film project by guidance from the system and other public users with steps from the broad picture in their minds into clearly structured sequences onto the screens.

<br><br>

**What our users need is not a better explanation, but a deeper understanding of the value and the guidance for practice.**
<br><br>
The platform includes:
1.   **search engine** that is based on keywords of genre or emotion 
2.   **visualized explanation** from films and user contents 
3.   **customized shot timeline** with instructional video and content management function
4.   **community of user-generated content** for sharing, learning, discussing, and evaluating.

# Project detail
<br><br>
What distinguishes our design is that the user **starts from their inquiry**, actively initiate their projects and construct their understanding.


As Seymour Papert once said: "You can't teach people everything they need to know. The best you can do is position them where they can find what they need to know when they need to know it.”


Once users decide on the genre or the emotion keyword in the search bar, then they have 2 options for the resource: “search film terms” and “search users’ examples”.

<br><br>

<br>
## 1. Search Engine 
<br><br>
 From the **classic film examples**, they would understand the value of the terms; from **user examples**, they can see how these terms are applied in real-world projects. This discovery learning experience would lead them to construct their knowledge. 
 
 In the process of comparing different video clips, it will promote users’ deep learning, their engagement and meta-cognitive skills (Bruner, 2009). Then they would choose the best-fit techniques for their projects, act as **a designer for their own learning path** and construct their knowledge.

## 2. Visualized Explanation

<br><br><br>
## 3. Community for Inspiration
<br><br>
Users can simply access the timelines published by others in the section “**inspiration**”, which is a community of user-generated content for sharing, learning, discussing, and evaluating. 

 In this section, users are allowed to share and post their own movies and add hashtags to it and the hashtags would enable other users to find this movie by searching the keywords. Once the movies are uploaded and shared, the **timeline** of this movie will become accessible **templates** for others to learn and use. 

For the users who do not have any or do not have enough experience, shooting a movie is an interesting and meaningful learning and problem-solving task for them but can be difficult to do alone. The process of browsing others’ movies and accessing other users’ timelines is similar to working with more competent peers and would allow them to learn from others and become able to complete the same task individually next time.

<br><br>

## 4. Customized Timeline
<br><br>
 The platform includes a **customized shot timeline** with instructional video and content management function.


As students get access to the timeline scaffolding, they can constantly modify their actions and stay on track, better manage the learning process. Also, they would focus on the meaningful learning process and constantly reflect on what they are doing (Reiser, 2014).

## What is next?
Our design provides a new way of searching that starts from users' inquiry, instead of searching on terminologies, we invite them to search emotion and genre based on their needs. We conducted user tests to verify the validity and effectiveness, it was clear that users like this new way of getting information and interaction, however, they are still curious what kind of keywords are allowed and how the search result can support their needs. So my next step is to talk with the professional in the film industry to improve the classification, and also work with engineers to see the opportunities on combining AI algorithm with the search result.
