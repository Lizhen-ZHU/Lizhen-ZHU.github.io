### The Problems

- For new students don't know the way to make friends quickly and join events as they interested in
- The messy interface results in many students spend lots of time searching, browsing and view diverse orientation events
- Some students cannot come to some interesting event due to their other schedules conflicted

### The Solutions

-  An intuitive application for students finding events in an easy and quick way
-  Discovering and searching events by categories, such as sports, music, visual art, volunteering and social
-  Helping the unable to be attended students can also experience the events and know what's happening in the real time by **Live**

### User Pain Point

- The wide range of events are always showing in a broad disorder every day
- Sometimes my schedule is conflict with many events that I'm interested in
- The flow for basic searching is always complicated to use

### Information Architecture

After making sure the main problems' target, I start to build this IA to help me clarify the useful and necessary features is gonna serve for my app.

#### Sketches

</div>

#### Lo-fi

After a series of rough sketches, to figure out user flows and overall layout, I start with wireframe first. My wireframe helps me to make sure the information hierarchy works in a right way.

**1.** The live-card is design to hlep some students who are too busy to attend in their interested events. Getting the fresh things happening in a different but practical way.

**2.** Showing the most popular events to help students finding event easier. To saving space of the screen, and avoid over-slidehi down, feel free to swipe cards to know more about popular.

**3.**  The sequence of events are showing by date. To know today's upcoming events easier.

**4.**  The floating search button will always wait in here to solve most of the searching needs.

**5.**  The **filter** card will pop up after tabing the searching button. ↑ And students can search events by the keywords, categories and dates. So that the home screen will showing as we want later.

**6.**  To catch students' attention, the event detail page shows the event big images or posters first, and the "**join**" button replace of the seaching floating button also attracts us to join it quickly. 

**7.**  Feel free to contact with event's organizer and asking what you're interests or anticipated for the event in the below comments.

### Illustrating Categories

School events are sorted by **Sports**, **Music**, **Visual art**, **Social group** and **Volunteering**. 
To make the visual style and system looks more intuitive and relaxable, I create some illustrations to suit for this product's basically users -- students!

#### 2. Searching Events

- The quick pop up card is showing from bottom to meet our searching needs.
- It can be distinguished by typing keyword, selecting category and selecting specific date and time.

###### Category Filtering 

To provide convenience for different students' searching experiences. That would be a better way when students consider different categories of events in the same timeline, which means we don't need to repeat searching and browsing this or that to wasting our time!
