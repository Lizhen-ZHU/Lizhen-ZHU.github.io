## Design Process

<br>

Axon is a mobile application that connect knowledge with social networks. I conducted the user-centered research and design process, from literature review to creating Hi-Fi prototypes, and validating design decisions by testing with target users. 
 
• **Product Ideation**: initiated and brainstormed on product features. 

• **User Research**: led the quantitative and qualitative user research, performed literature review of 30+ essays to identify user pain points and analyzed the design of 14 existing learning application models.

• **Product Iteration**: facilitated prototyping and sketching, created user personas and customer journey map, designed prototypes and wireframes to test assumptions and concepts, created high-fidelity screen designs and animated walkthrough of the UI.

• **Product Management**: conducted user tests to verify the validity and effectiveness, collected data through observations and interviews with 10 users, analyzed their needs and feedbacks, revised the products accordingly.

### Project Brief:

As a combination of **social-networking** and **learning management system**, Axon provides its users a virtual learning environment and platform that featured by professional networks, online courses, and performance management. This social learning network enables users to connect with and learn from anyone, anywhere, and anytime to develop knowledge and skills.

## My reflection
This is my first UX design, at that time I just really excited and confident about everything I created.

But recently I reflected and looked back on the design process, I noticed that there is something that I should avoid to do.

Once I start design and brainstorming, I devoted too much commitment on details and UIs, which:

1.	Harder for me to reflect on the problem. Devote too much time on energy on detail constrain me to think out of the box. ‘Visual sugar’ can hide structural issues.

2.	Eliciting honest feedback. An important advantage of paper prototypes is their sketchy look. The prototypes don’t look like I’ve spent a lot of time on them. As a result, people feel more comfortable criticizing sketches rather than polished designs.

It is necessary to **keep the sketches fast, rough and dirty**, because a paper sketch is low cost, low commitment, good for rapid iteration and team building. This would helps me worry less on design aesthetics and focus more on rapid formulation of ideas.
