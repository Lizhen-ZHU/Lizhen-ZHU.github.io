### Project Brief:

  Have you ever felt lost in a new school and eager to access resources that you needed? <br>
  Do you want to personalize your daily orientation routine and get connected in a bigger community? <br>
  This mobile event app “open sesame” will help you **get involved, stay organized, access resources and get connected** during orientation. 
  
  
### Objective:

  The project focuses on experience for students to discover orientation events and craft a visual system to accommodate different types of events: sports, music, visual arts, social groups, and volunteering events. It provides high-fidelity mocks for searching, browsing, and viewing the details for these different events.
