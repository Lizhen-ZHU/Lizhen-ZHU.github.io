### Work and Achievements:

• Created and delivered [Umoja](https://ilearn.umoja.un.org/) (UN's enterprise resource planning software) curricula for virtual training environments.<br>
• Defined, planned and executed project plans to create new effective learning experience and high-quality
learning solutions following ADDIE methodology.<br>
• Partnered with SMEs and Project Manager to design and develop end-to-end e-learning projects, maintained best
industry practice and standard for capturing screens, developed technical learning content, built interactive
SCORM tutorials, developed training aids, course tests, evaluations and assessments for certification.<br>
• Contributed to the improvement of processes and curriculum templates to minimize the development time for
training materials.<br>
• Designed **30+ Adobe Captivate courses** and **400+ pages project documents** for Umoja used by over 85 countries
globally, increasing the aptitude of employees to perform in their roles with 98% success of designed outcomes.<br>
<br><br>
### Design Process:
I lead the project throughout the **whole design lifecycle**, responsible for the in-and-out of designing IT training courses **following the ADDIE methodology**. I analyzed, designed, develop, implement and evaluate IT training materials from scratch.<br>

“ADDIE” stands for Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate.



#### Analyze
Before I start developing any content or training strategies, I will conduct **Training Needs Analysis, Audience Analysis, Task Analysis**, etc. <br>
**Collaborate with the technical team and SMEs** to understand the current situation and to also understand what is the goal of the training itself.
<br>

#### Design
After analyzing the learning objective, I would collaborate with the training team to break down the technical elements, build **scenarios, storyboard, personas, set learning goals, design course structures**, and bring the best practice and standard for the tutorial.
<br>
This includes strategy, delivery methods, structure, duration, assessment, and feedback. The next step is to storyboard my ideas and create a prototype. I am creating a blueprint for the courses, and by making a prototype I can quickly communicate with other stakeholders the value of the training.
<br>

#### Develop

In this phase, I will use **Adobe Captivate,** choose and add the final graphics, multimedia, colors, and fonts to make my course look polished and professional. I will also use the authoring tools to build out activities, quizzes, interactions, and functional navigation to create an engaging course.
<br>

#### Implement

Once my course is fully developed and thoroughly tested, I am ready to share it with learners. Typically, during the Implementation phase, the materials are shared in one of two ways: by uploading it directly to the **web** or to a **Learning Management System (LMS)**.
<br>

#### Evaluate

Once I’ve created the content, I would meet with specialists to **QA the training materials, iterate the design**. Things that need to be tested and reviewed include spelling, grammar, learning objectives, navigation, and flow.

### Media Design
I advocate for innovative solutions and the continuous improvement of our training methods.
<br>
At mean time, I produce learning materials using a wide variety of tools including graphics software to better organize the teamwork. I designed timeline for workflows, guideline for the training team, about how to use Adobe Captivate, checklist before uploading a course, as well as the templates of building new e-learning course.
