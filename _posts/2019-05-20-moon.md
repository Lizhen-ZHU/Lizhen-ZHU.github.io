## What is the Moonlight?

The **Moonlight** is a creative technology product that sparkles based on the wax and wane of the moon, and also as an interactive product that provide distance messaging. It incorporates 3D printing, Arduino, Micro:bit, and laser cut.

#### Design process: 3D printing 
**3D printed** three-dimensional moon lamp is a kind of table lamp, as the name suggests, its shape resembles the moon. Its biggest feature is to make a prototype of the moon in proportion to the moon, which is 3D printed into shape. The relief on the surface of the lamp shows the concave and convex light and shade of the moon surface with the help of its thickness and transmittance

I try to 3D print the moon for 4 times, but none of them finished.

    <h6> The first try </h6>
    <br>
   Use the MakerBot Print Software and 3D printer, adding the moon model to the virtual build plate.

    <h6> The second try </h6>
    <br> 
    A 7cm lamp takes 15 hours to print, with the resolution of 0.2 and infill 20.

    <h6> The third and last try </h6>
    <br>
   I try to 3D print the moon for 4 times, but none of them finished.

<br>
<br>

However, I still got the half of the moon. Based on that, I use flowers to decorate. This kind of flower, babysbreath, has a Chinese name called “满天星”– starry sky. When the LED strings light up inside, each flower will be shining like real stars in the night.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### 2. Design process: Arduino and LED
<br>

For the LED lights inside, I used 6 tubes to represent the wax and wane of the moon. (The period in which a Moon will go from a New Moon to a Full Moon and back again is known as “Lunar Month”. One of these lasts 28 days, and encompasses what are known as “waxing” and “waning” Moons. During the former period, the Moon brightens and its angle relative to the Sun and Earth increases.) For the real project, I would light up the lamp differently according to the real moon. But now I speed up the period, each LED will light 1s. And I use Ardurio forLoopInteration to control the light, making it light one by one and reverse.

#### 2. Design process: Micro:bit distance message
<br>

The radio in Micro:bit provides opportunity for 2 Micro:bit to send and receive data between each other in a distance. I include a Micro:bit distance message function to control a pin, thus one people can send their love to another. Even we are in far distance, I still can send my feeling with you.

#### 3. Design process: Laser cut
<br>

The last part is the laser cut, I build a box base to hide the circuits, making it a whole part of the artifact.

情人怨遥夜，竟夕起相思。(望月怀远, 张九龄)<br><br>

Bright moon are rising from the sea,<br><br>

From far away you share this moment with me.<br><br>

For parted lovers lonely nights are the worst to be.<br><br>

All night long I think of no one but thee.<br><br><br>

<!-- ### Breakaway

During the design iterations and getting feedback from our team, I found out that there is a lot to consider when designing for the handwriting recognition and image-recognize platform.

First of all, I need to consider different formula has different weight and height. I'm going to try different types of mathematicals formula as I searched, to fix them in the box container. And then I also need to figure out potential problems when user use it as much as possible, such as using the function of self-association, to correct mistake formula that user drawed.

To find a method to make UI elements looks well-organized, I leant a lot from **Google Material Design** and experienced how important that design system works in UI. -->
