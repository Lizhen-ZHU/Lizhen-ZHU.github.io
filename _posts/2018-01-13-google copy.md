### The Problems

- For new students don't know the way to make friends quickly and join events as they interested in
- The messy interface results in many students spend lots of time searching, browsing and view diverse orientation events
- Some students cannot come to some interesting event due to their other schedules conflicted

### The Solutions

-  An intuitive application for students finding events in an easy and quick way
-  Discovering and searching events by categories, such as sports, music, visual art, volunteering and social
-  Helping the unable to be attended students can also experience the events and know what's happening in the real time by **Live**

### User Pain Point

- The wide range of events are always showing in a broad disorder every day
- Sometimes my schedule is conflict with many events that I'm interested in
- The flow for basic searching is always complicated to use

### Information Architecture

After making sure the main problems' target, I start to build this IA to help me clarify the useful and necessary features is gonna serve for my app.

#### Sketches

</div>

#### Lo-fi

After a series of rough sketches, to figure out user flows and overall layout, I start with wireframe first. My wireframe helps me to make sure the information hierarchy works in a right way.

**1.** The live-card is design to hlep some students who are too busy to attend in their interested events. Getting the fresh things happening in a different but practical way.

**2.** Showing the most popular events to help students finding event easier. To saving space of the screen, and avoid over-slidehi down, feel free to swipe cards to know more about popular.

**3.**  The sequence of events are showing by date. To know today's upcoming events easier.

**4.**  The floating search button will always wait in here to solve most of the searching needs.

**5.**  The **filter** card will pop up after tabing the searching button. â†‘ And students can search events by the keywords, categories and dates. So that the home screen will showing as we want later.

**6.**  To catch students' attention, the event detail page shows the event big images or posters first, and the "**join**" button replace of the seaching floating button also attracts us to join it quickly. 

**7.**  Feel free to contact with event's organizer and asking what you're interests or anticipated for the event in the below comments.

### Illustrating Categories

School events are sorted by **Sports**, **Music**, **Visual art**, **Social group** and **Volunteering**. 
To make the visual style and system looks more intuitive and relaxable, I create some illustrations to suit for this product's basically users -- students!

#### 2. Searching Events

- The quick pop up card is showing from bottom to meet our searching needs.
- It can be distinguished by typing keyword, selecting category and selecting specific date and time.

###### Category Filtering 

To provide convenience for different students' searching experiences. That would be a better way when students consider different categories of events in the same timeline, which means we don't need to repeat searching and browsing this or that to wasting our time!
