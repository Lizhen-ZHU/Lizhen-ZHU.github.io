### Is that also your morning?

It is hard to <b> get out of your whole night sleep mode</b>. 
<br>

I still **have lots of stuff to do**
<br>

I **don't have a good mood** in dealing with these **daily-routines**
<br>

I always forget this or that, cause the **time is always in the rush**
<br>

The **living atmosphere** is **not motivated** and **humanized** enough for me to start a new day.

### Improve it !

Everyone has personal different schedule and time-management in the morning

My solution is to build a connection with all of the smart home devices, and asking them to assist for your **daily morning routine** together ! 

The smart devices could be the **light, water boiler, google home, bathtub, oven, microwave**...  Anything you need in the morning, they can prepare for **methodic and orderly as your morning routine**

### Some of my Working Process

Thanks my professor Miguel and my classmates help me combing the flow’s logic and improving it day by day. 

Initially, I’m not familiar with how the **smart devices work**, how to make a well-organized connection with them.

To learn more about these products’**operate mechanism**. I made research and analysis existing products like “ IFTTT,” “Fabulous,” and “shortcuts.” It gave me a lot of ideas and inspirations as the reference.
