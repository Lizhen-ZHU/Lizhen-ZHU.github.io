### Project description

<br> <br>

‘Adventure in LALALAND’ is a commercial website with the movie theme, focuses on storytelling visualization and human-computer interaction. 

In this website, users will have a taste of the movie within the time of a song and explore all the possibilities by themselves. With the music, the virtual effect and the user interaction, users could have a deeper understanding of the story itself and also the message that the movie wants to tell us. 

In the technical part, this project uses pure CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery with no other libraries. This project gave me the opportunity to utilize all aspects of the user-centered design process, including UX Research (research, wireframing, prototyping), Design (visual, UI, interaction, motion) as well as Front-End Development (HTML/CSS/JS).

### Project detail
Hello, welcome to my website ‘Adventure in LALALAND’. This is a commercial website with the movie theme, based on the movie 'LA LA LAND'. 

I want users to have a taste of the movie within the time of a song and explore all the possibilities by themselves. With the music, the virtual effect and the user interaction, people could have a deeper understanding of the story itself and also the message/idea that the movie wants to tell us.

### Page One -Piano

In the first page, people would see a simple virtual piano and the dancing background. People may feel confused for the first time since I didn't tell them what they should do and what to expect.  But I designed it on purpose. I want the users to explore the page and get into the story by themselves and the piano serves as a key. 

By randomly pressing the key, the alert shows up and tell them what to do. Then following the correct instruction, they will find the secret password to enter the LALALAND. And the user will be surprised by what they did since these four keys are also the first sound of the theme music, which is also connected to the next page

### Page Two -Trailer

After they step into the story, here comes to the official trailer with the big movie name. The sound starts to play after we press the right keyboard. With the romantic music and movie scene, users could better understand the theme and content of this movie, also bring wonderful audio-visual enjoyment to the users. What is more, there is a comment section that is renewed every 5 seconds, telling more information to the users about this movie.

### Page Three- Cast

By clicking the navigation bar on the top, the page will lead you to the other section. In the cast part, there are 2 characteristics. The CSS animation enables users to hover over the picture; JavaScript creates the typing lyrics. The combination of two effects creates the illusion that the main actors are telling you the story right now.

### Page Four- Map

In the map section, I want to create a mixed reality for users. Since this story has happened in LA, I create a SVG map to represent the real world. Users could click on each part, and the scene that happened in that area will show up, leading users to explore the story as well as the LA city.




### Page Five- Ticket

In the last section, typing words show again. The reverse of the worlds tells users that the end of this story does not mean the end of everything. I try to connect the movie to the real world by asking them to create their own story. I offer them an input section that they can type in the name of a person that they care about. Then, the name will automatically fill in the next ticket page that they can use for a real-world invitation to someone, to start their own romance.


Movie story may have an ending, but our story just beginning. [Hi, can I invite you to watch a movie with me?](https://lizhen-zhu.github.io/lala-land/index.html)
